# Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment: Course Project 2

This is the course project required for the “Exploratory Data Analysis” offered from Coursera. A R programming scripts with outputs have been developed to perform the tasks as expected in the Assessment Course Project 2 within the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The basic function of the R scripts are as follows.

1. The R scripts will be run over the data downloaded from the "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip" and copied over the working directory.
2. The script will load the data into the R system from the working directory and create the subsets and perform other analyses as required.
3. The graphs will be generated and stored in the working directory as "png". The required libraries like "ggplot2" have to be activated to ploth the graphs.
4. All the progran scripts are stored in the same working directory.
